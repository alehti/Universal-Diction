# Universal-Diction
System to interpret a vocabulary to any dialect without a proper form to pronounce. It's universal within your language, not for all languages. It's a style that allows you to show which words for the user to pronounce in their dialect, and then apply it to the new word. This way, we can knock down a bad human trait. 

1. denote words which contain the correct sounds
2. encase the correct sylabbles
3. write out only sylables (~ con~nects flow)

Q: is it useful?

A: not really; I really dislike snobby people who think dialects make them superior. It's a really poor flavor of gene.
