# Universal-Diction
System to interpret a vocabulary to any dialect without a proper form to pronounce. It's universal within your language, not for all languages. It's a style that allows you to show which words for the user to pronounce in their dialect, and then apply it to the new word. This way, we can knock down a bad human trait. 

1. denote words which contain the correct sounds
2. encase the correct sylabbles
3. write out only sylables (~ con~nects flow) 

Here are candidates for three new words, all of which mean similar ideas:

infecilis - unjust, unfavorable, hostile, unsuitable, unteachable, inferior
iniqulis - unjust, unfavorable, hostile, unsuitable, unteachable
incilis - echo above

______
**innate nicked queue list;**

in~nic-que-lis
____
**innate sill trust;**
(**in**)nate (**sil**)l tr(**us**)t:

Q: is it useful?
A: not really; I really dislike snobby people who think dialects make them superior. It's a really poor flavor of gene.
